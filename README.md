# JavaScript Linked List Implementation
*This file is meant for educational purposes only*

## What this is...
Using JavaScript prototype pattern, I've created an implementation of a **Singly** Linked Node List. The file `linked_list.js` includes a `Node` class, `SinglyLinkedList` class, prototype methods for the `SinglyLinkedList` class, and some testing of behavior that outputs results to the console.

## Functionality 
- You can arbitrarily add and delete nodes from a singly linked list.
- Stack behavior
  * push 
  * pop 
  * top
- Queue behavior
  * enqueue
  * dequeue
  * peek

## How to Run (using a terminal node REPL)
1. Clone repo by running:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:gittheking/linked_lists.git
```
in your terminal.

2. Navigate into the `linked_list` directory

3. If you have Node installed on your machine you can run the `.js` file with 
```
$ node linked_list.js
```

4. Play with it and test your understanding of LL's.
